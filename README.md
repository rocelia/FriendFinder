# FriendFinder


Friend Finder is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application (very similar to a dating app). The user completes a survey and those results are compared with answers from other users. The app then displays the name and photo of the user with the best overall match.

The app is implemented using Node.js and Express (back end) as well as Bootstrap (front end).
